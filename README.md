Weird Blackjack is a twist on the classic casino card game, blending strategic decisions with unpredictable card effects. The objective remains the same: achieve a hand total as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. However, the game introduces unique card effects, modes, and complexities that elevate the experience.

**Two Modes of Play:**

1.  Number Cards Only Mode: Play with a simplified deck of numeric cards (1-6), where strategy revolves around managing your hand total.
2.  Face Cards Mode: Adds face cards (Jack, Queen, King) and card suits (Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts) with unique effects, making the gameplay more dynamic.
Card Effects:

Numeric cards add their value to your hand. **Face cards introduce special effects:**  
- Jack: Halves your total.  
- Queen: Doubles your total.  
- King: Alters the value of the next card drawn.  

Cards now have suits, and the **suit's color affects the total:**  
- Black suits (Spades, Clubs) _just add to the total as normal._  
- Red suits (Diamonds, Hearts) _subtract half from the total_ (rounded down) .  

Game Outcomes:  
- Blackjack: Achieve exactly 21 and **win**  
- Bust: Exceed 21 and **lose**.  
- Manual Stop: End your turn and see how your score compares.
